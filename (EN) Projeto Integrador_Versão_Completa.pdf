a. At least 01 different site blocking technique per student;
b. Authenticated Proxy;
c. Generation and analysis of logs.
c) DHCP Server:
a. Create a DHCP server for the computers in Laboratory II.
d) Domain Server:
a. Create a domain to be used by the students' notebooks, which has the entire access security structure and file writing.
b. Each student should have a base folder where they can save their files.
e) LDAP Server:

i) Web Server:
a. This service should provide HTTP page service.
j) Java Application Server:
a. This server should provide Java services.
Materials and Methods:
a) The Linux server will be installed on a computer provided by Prof. Rogério, which will not contain any type of OS, and it will be up to the students to choose the best Linux distribution;
b) The students will be fully responsible for taking care of this computer;
c) The class must elect a student responsible for the server, who will be the direct contact with the professor.
d) If network cables are necessary for server connections, these will be the responsibility of the students.
e) This server must, in the Audit classes, be the gateway for LAB II computers.
f) All types of reference materials may be used to complete the tasks described above.
Team Organization: The organization of work in the classroom will be up to the students. Tasks can be divided into activities or items.
Evaluation:
a) At the end of the semester, on a date to be defined, there will be a seminar for the presentation of the work done, as well as the difficulties encountered. This presentation will be individual, meaning students must perform at least one activity related to the general server configurations.
